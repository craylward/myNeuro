     The task view controller calls this method when an unrecoverable error occurs,
     when the user has canceled the task (with or without saving), or when the user
     completes the last step in the task.
     
     In most circumstances, the receiver should dismiss the task view controller
     in response to this method, and may also need to collect and process the results
     of the task.
     
     @param taskViewController  The `ORKTaskViewController `instance that is returning the result.
     @param reason              An `ORKTaskViewControllerFinishReason` value indicating how the user chose to complete the task.
     @param error               If failure occurred, an `NSError` object indicating the reason for the failure. The value of this parameter is `nil` if `result` does not indicate failure.
